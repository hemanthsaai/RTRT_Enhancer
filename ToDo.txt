TODO  :  Create a function to check the compatibility
         can test cases be created to the c function?
         if yes, Only then create test case else don't create a tet case
            report the issue in line


TODO  : Variable limits has to be converted from string to int/float
        for calculating MIN-1 etc

TODO  : Differenciate b/w functions in testcase
TODO  : Take Dependency file as input and find the variable declaration // Is it needed?

TODO  :  local variable initialisations to be handled
         example   int a = 20;

TODO : isnumeric is not working for float

TODO  : If RHS do not have any limits then use limits of LHS to test

TODO  :   Target
          PTU script for Test.c


Challenges AHEAD:
TODO  : no backward compatibility
        example:
        a = b;
        c = a;
        In this case script has no idea if a is already initialized
        if a is initialized from b and c is initialised from a then script also has to follow the flow

TODO  : no compatibility to statements like this
        a = b * c;
        a = (TRUE == b);
        arithmetic operation statements has to be handled

TODO  : Conditions has to be handled
        if (a == 10)
        {
            Test case to be created only for this part
        }
        else
        {
            Test case to be created only for this part
        }
        similarly switches also

TODO  :  If a line is not assignment then save it to a file saying to which the test case is not generated

TODO  :  Report an error if the boundaries of LHS is less than Boundary of RHS
TODO  :  Report the variables not available in A2L



understanding
if LHS has more strings without ( at all then consider it not a assignment
